      <ul>
        <li>One day, in retrospect, the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful. -- <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/33232-one-day-in-retrospect-the-years-of-struggle-will-strike">Sigmund Freud</a>
        </li>
        <li>Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will stand in the presence of kings. He will not stand in the presence of unknown men. -- <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/csb/proverbs/22-29.html">Proverbs 22:29 (Holy Bible)</a>
        </li>
        <li>I went to college. I went to law school. I worked in law and banking, though not for terribly long. But not until I started PayPal did I fully realize that you don‚Äôt have to wait to start something. Sometimes, you have to actually go through the complex, 10-year trajectory. But it‚Äôs at least worth asking whether that‚Äôs the story you‚Äôre telling yourself, or whether that‚Äôs the reality. -- <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/10/heres-what-billionaire-peter-thiel-wishes-hed-known-in-his-20s.html">Peter Thiel</a></li>
