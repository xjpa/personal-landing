          <li>Prompt GPT to generate a course</li>
          <blockquote>
            e.g. "my background is XXXXX, I know YYYYYY and ZZZZZ. My goal is to
            be able to replicate and write a toy implementation of this paper in
            [insert programming language], craft me a crash course and then a
            hands-on curriculum to learn the necessary skills and fill my
            knowledge gaps, complete with projects, exercises, and guidelines to
            accomplish such projects."
          </blockquote>
        </ol>
        <p>Thats it. Follow it and build.</p>
        <p>Use GPT or some other LLM that can mentor you as you build</p>

          Good! Errors are pivot points. Opportunities in disguise. Spotting
          AI's occasional BS sharpens your instincts faster than reading Stack
          Overflow. In fact, those are precisely the moments when real learning
          kicks in.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's simply the <u>PIVOT POINT</u>: the golden moment you realize
          you steered slightly wrong, and pivot towards clarity.
        </p>
        <p>Learning is about exploration and iterative refinement:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>You throw an attempt</li>
          <li>Find out if itâ€™s off</li>
          <li>Then pivot</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          And AI models are now good in helping you pivot faster, because they
          throw out many possible directions while giving the highlight reels of
          each, potentially saving hundreds to thousands of hours. I'm writing
          an OS from scratch now for a grad school Advanced Operating Systems
          class. I was able to tackle this problem because of LLMs. With AI, you
          can literally just build things
        </p>
        <p>
          The only problem with AI learning is the same as watching developer
          conferences and CS lectures. There is no practice for information
          retrieval, which is the key to encoding the new knowledge deep into
          your brain.
        </p>
        <p>
          So remember to also include memory retrieval activities on your own:
          note taking, presenting, spaced repetition, implementing the concept
          to code, quizzes (I use remnote: anki style spaced repetition flash
          card software), whatever learning style fits best
        </p>
