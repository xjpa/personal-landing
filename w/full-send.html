          <p>you realize that youre never going to be young forever</p>
          <p>
            "young" = living with no worries, like the start of a studio ghibli

            and i feel it. I can no longer lift the kettlebells and barbells as
            recklessly as I used to without the thought of some scapula or back
            problem. i jumped out of an obstacle at a spartan race, and oops,
            suddenly i learned there's fall damage in this game called life.
            what happened? you used to be wolverine
          </p>
          <p>
            and it's not just your physique. recently i tried to learn japanese
            and realized i can no longer learn a language as fast as I used to.
            and yet when i was 19, i was able to memorize at least 100 french
            words in a few hours to impress a french exchange student who was
            volunteering at a charity i spent weekends helping at. remember when
            you used to be able to cram chapters worth of university STEM
            material in a weekend to ace the exam? impossible now unless youre

          <p>perhaps youve also experienced a few more things:</p>
          <blockquote>
            that the job you dreamed of didnt save you, that relationship you
            had wasnt worth it, your body no longer recovers from a fall or some
            accident as fast as when you were 15, or that ambitious 5-year plan
            you developed during undergrad might take longer

          <p>too many people think about purpose or certainty</p>
          <p>they delay their decisions, thinking about a masterplan</p>
          <p>you want to feel alive?</p>
          <p>to break out of the void?</p>
          <p>movement, acceleration, momentum</p>
          <p>
            you are not here to seek clarity, you are here to act. you dont sit
            in doubt, you pujnch through it. you dont seek purpose, you move too
            fast for despair to catch up. you were never meant to be still, for
            stillness are for corpses and statues.
          </p>
          <p>because fren, the meaning is to be the blur</p>
          <p>why think about meaning of life when you can just:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>gain muscle</li>
            <li>talk to people, dance, date</li>
            <li>do adventures with friends</li>
            <li>live life</li>
            <li>have fun</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            why think about certainty, or the optimal way to do X, when you can:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>say yes to a job and learn as you go</li>
            <li>gain direct or diagonal exposure by accepting a task</li>
            <li>stack asymmetric XP while ppl overthink</li>
            <li>
              sprint into roles youre not ready for, instead of waiting and
              hoping you can get promoted
            </li>
            <li>fake it til you make it, execute and learn in the trenches</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            youve watched too many andrew huberman/peak performance podcasts and
            read too many reddit threads to find out the best way to do X
          </p>
          <p>but enlightenment is in the action, it is kinetic</p>

            aim to maximize the rate of learning, not the prettiness of priors.

            before you can get the hot girl. this is not a checklist game,

          <p>you are not here to understand, youre here to devour</p>
          <p>look at F1 racers</p>
          <p>
            zero fear, high test, masters of flow, goddamn war artists on the
            edge of death and mythology with a war stare. racing like its their
            last day on earth. this is a realm of men, one that demands
            <b>kill instinct</b>. hesitation means death. the field only
            respects aggression. life is the same.
          </p>
          <p>see the contrast. ask:</p>
          <blockquote>
            what am I willing to risk to feel alive again?
          </blockquote>
          <p>ask a pilot if theyre afraid of plane crashes, they arent</p>
          <p>one pilot's reply was concise and struck me best:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"Death comes fast. It wont even hurt."</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            they are not fixated in death, <mark>they are fixated in life</mark>
          </p>
          <p>
            they dont fear death the way overthinkers do. because theyve already
            decided that theyre willing to risk for what they want. theyre not
            fantasizing dying in their sleep at 93, they only think about what
            theyre going to do next

            dont think, just do. everyone overthinks, they think they are
            gaining some alpha signal or uncovering some hidden strategy. but
            thinking is for civilians, operators execute. youve already spent
            months thinking about that job/gradschool application, business

          <p>
            thereis no alpha, and operators dont calculate every variable. i've
